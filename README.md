Discrete Structures Analysis on Pokec Social Network Dataset
Project Features:
Data Import and Parsing: Efficiently read and process large data files containing user profiles and relationships.

Discrete Mathematics Analysis:

Propositions: Evaluate logical statements involving user attributes.
Quantifiers: Analyze properties that hold for specific groups of users.
Set Operations: Perform union, intersection, and complement operations on user sets.
Functions: Map user IDs to attributes and validate injectivity and surjectivity properties.
Relations: Analyze properties like reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity in user friendships.
Induction: Proofs using structural and strong induction on dataset properties.
Permutations & Combinations: Count and organize user subgroups based on criteria.
Counting: Generate statistical reports, including completion percentages and regional user counts.
